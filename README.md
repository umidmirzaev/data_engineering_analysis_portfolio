# Umid Mirzaev - Data Engineering & Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Umid!
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering and a Master's degree (M.S.) in Petroleum Logistics from Molde University College in Norway, where I specialized in Mathematical Modeling and Data Analysis. Over the past three years, I've gained experience in IT, working as a Data Analyst, Database Administrator, and Infrastructure Engineer at consulting firms.

This repository serves as a platform to showcase my skills, share my data analysis projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Engineering-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I list data engineering & analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Cohort Analysis
**Code:** [Cohort Analysis](https://github.com/umidmirzaev/data_engineering_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Cohort%20Analysis.ipynb)  
**Description:** This project analyzes transactional data from a homebrewing and craft brewing supply store using cohort analysis. The goal is to track and understand user behavior over time, identifying trends and patterns.  
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Sata Visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Cohort retention and revenue trends were found and analyzed.

### RFM Analysis
**Code:** [RFM Analysis](https://github.com/umidmirzaev/data_engineering_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/RFM%20Analysis.ipynb)  
**Description:** Applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment and identify customer groups for a local retail company, exploring differences to drive data-informed marketing strategies.   
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Sata Visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Segmented and identified customers into high-value (38%), growth-potential (40%), and at-risk (19%) groups. Recommendations include targeted rewards, promotions, and re-engagement strategies.  

### Marketing Data Analysis
**Code:** [Marketing Data Analysis](https://github.com/umidmirzaev/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Marketing%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)  
**Description:** The main dataset contains 19360 records related to synthetic marketing data that simulates campaign performance across various states. The dataset records key metrics such as total touchpoints, state-specific responses (both web and phone), and conversion outcomes over a defined time period. Additional information on each campaign includes costs and identifiers, offering insights into marketing efforts and resource allocation.     
**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.   
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the marketing campaign performance across various states. 

### Logistics Operations and Task Management
**Link:** [Logistics Operations and Task Management](https://github.com/umidmirzaev/logistics-operations)  
**Description:** A Power BI project focused on transforming and analyzing logistics operations data to improve task management and operational efficiency. The project involved loading raw logistics data into Power BI, applying extensive data transformations with Power Query, and creating a clear, structured table for analysis. The goal was to clean the dataset, structure key information fields, and produce insights on task durations and logistics performance.   
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Transformation.  
**Technology:** Power Query, M Language (Power Query Formula Language), Power BI.  
**Results:**  Successfully loaded and transformed logistics operations data, filtering out irrelevant tasks and restructuring the table for clarity. Developed a detailed, easy-to-navigate table that allows logistics teams to track task statuses, durations, and other essential metrics.  

### Email Marketing Campaign Analysis
**Link:** [Email Marketing Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/umidmirzaev/Email-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis)   
**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing the performance of email marketing campaigns for a local business. The goal was to develop a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to help the marketing team and executives monitor campaign effectiveness and user engagement.    
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Performance Tracking.  
**Technology:** Power BI, DAX.  
**Results:** Analysis of user activity, email trends, and customer segments over time.
